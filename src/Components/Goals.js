            I am a hard worker and a fast learner. I love a good challenge to
            test my problem-solving skills. I have a range of experience with
            software engineering, including various programming languages,
            frameworks, and tools. I can work autonomously and in a team. I am
            looking for full stack and backend software engineering opportunities where
            I can continue to learn and develop my skills and where I can make a difference.
