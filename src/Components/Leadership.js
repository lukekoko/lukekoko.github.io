            In one of my university subjects software engineering studio 2B the subject focuses on teamwork and working as a team to develop a project. In this subject I joined a team of 12 students and we were working on a web application prototype to present at the end of the semester. 
            My role in the team was the software architect and full stack team leader. I set up the technology stack for the project and helped other team members when they needed help, along with doing development on my own assigned functionalities. 
            At the end of the semester we had a solid prototype to show the class and we achieved a mark high distinction mark for that class.
